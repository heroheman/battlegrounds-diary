    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p>I love the new Battleground Mode in Hearthstone. So much that I barely play regular Hearthstone anymore. The only thing that it is missing is a decent "Stat" Page. So I build a manual Game tracker by myself.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">But what about the Ingame Stats?</h3>
    <p>Yeah - whats up with them. Without a "total games played" view, they are pretty useless.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Can I sync my data?</h3>
    <p>Right now: <strong>No.</strong></p>
    <p>All your data is saved in your browser - and should stay there as long you don't delete your browser data or use the webapp with Incognito Mode.</p>
    <p>For synced data I would need to setup a database, some kind of login system and a huge amount of time.</p>
    <p>But I will keep an eye on my page stats and maybe I will add this.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Can I import and export my data?</h3>
    <p>Yes:<strong>Sadly no</strong></p>
    <p>Open the Settings Page and you can import / export your data. There is also some kind of backupsystem in case something goes wrong.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Is there an app?</h3>
    <p>No. And not planned. But if you are using the Chrome Browser on Android you can add any page to your Homescreen and it will look like an app.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Dude... your english... it's horrible!</h3>
    <p>Yes. It is. And not my native language. Also I edit a lot on mobile devices and Autocomplete and me are mortal enemies. But feel free to write me an e-mail with corrections and feedback. Or create a Pull Request on Github.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">The code is on Github?</h3>
    <p>Yes. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/heroheman/battlegrounds-diary">here</a>- I would love to get some feedback, issues and Pull Requests there!</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">WTF is a 'heroheman'?</h3>
    <p>It's a stupid joke - based on a crappy german-to-english translation of my last name.</p>
